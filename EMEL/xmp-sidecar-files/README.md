### Generating XMP sidecar files for a folder of TIFF images

This is a bash script, so can be run on Mac or Linux. On Windows, you will need to run in the Babun shell or have bash activated in PowerShell.

To run the script, navigate to the folder containing the script and type the following at the prompt:
`bash xmpfromtiff-win.sh`

*Alternately, you can type `bash` and drag the script onto the terminal window to paste the full path*

The script will prompt for the path to the TIFF images and to the location where you want to create the XMP files - drag and drop the folders at each prompt onto the terminal to paste the path, then hit Enter.

You may get an error message about locale settings, but you can ignore these. It may take a while to generate the XMP files.
